# spb-house-age-telegram-bot

This is the repository for the service (and in the future a bot) that supplies information on the age and construction year of the selected building in Saint-Petersburg.

There are two planned ways to retrieve data:
 - by inserting an address string,
 - by supplying a longitude and latitude points.
 
 The second option requires research on what services can provide the conversion between the geopoint and the address, and what licence terms are expected from us.
